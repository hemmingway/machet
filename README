Release notes:

0.5.1
Fixed a big typo in the configuration file setting names. Why didn't anybody 
tell me that the plural of path is paths and not pathes...? And why did I not 
see this for over one year? Embarrassing!

0.5.0
First public release of working code. 
Supported third party software:
 - Icarus Verilog
 - GHDL (Linux only)
 - ModelSim
 - Xilinx ISE/Vivado (FPGAs only, not for CPLDs)
 - Altera Quartus II/Quartus Prime (not tested very well)
 - Synoplify
